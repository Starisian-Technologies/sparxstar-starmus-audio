# Starisian Technologies License Headers

This file defines the required license header for every source file in this repository.

Copy the appropriate header into every source file in a Starisian Technologies project.

## Full License Header

Use in all primary source files (e.g., main modules, core libraries, dataset processors).

Every `.js` and `.py` source file (excluding `__init__.py`) must begin with the appropriate header block below. The CI `license-headers` job enforces this on every PR.

## Notes


-   `__init__.py` files are exempt --- they may be empty or contain only package declarations.
-   The CI check scans for the string `Copyright (c) Starisian Technologies` as the presence marker.
-   Headers must appear before any other content in the file (including docstrings and imports).
-   For Python files, the header appears before the module docstring.
